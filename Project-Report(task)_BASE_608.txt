Project Description: The "Online Tasks" project is a web application 
that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently and 
organizedly. The application provides a user-friendly interface where 
users can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, delete unwanted tasks, and 
mark tasks as completed once finished.
Key Features:
1. Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks by specifying a title and 
description.
2. Edit Tasks: Users are allowed to edit the title and description of 
existing tasks.
3. Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
4. Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed 
to indicate they have been done.
5. Filter Tasks: The ability to filter tasks based on their status 
(completed or pending) is provided.
6. Data Persistence: Tasks will be stored locally in the user's 
browser using HTML5 local storage, allowing users to access 
their tasks even after closing and reopening the application.
Source of External Data: The application does not rely on any external 
data source, as all tasks are managed and stored locally in the user's 
browser. This means users do not need to register or log in, and all 
functionality is available offline without an internet connection.
Project Objectives:
• Provide users with a simple and efficient way to manage their 
daily tasks.
• Demonstrate the ability to build interactive and functional web 
applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
• Practice using the browser's local storage capabilities to persist 
data between sessions.
